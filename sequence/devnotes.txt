Oct 27, 2024: combine epi calibration and slice-grappa (mb=1) calibration scans into one
 ==> by simply setting 'doRefScan = true' for mb=1 scan. 
 This gives slice-by-slice ghost calibration data.

From early 2024:
Other recent changes:
  * getsmspulse.m: put first slice at -mb/2 (remove shift of +sliceSep/2)
     * writeEPI.m: accordingly, remove shift of -sliceSep/2 (rf.freqOffset)
  * set maxView = np x etl when mb>1, etl otherwise
  * Fixed slice offset for mb=1
  * etl=72 (multiple of mb=6)
  * TR=800ms
  * Add RF spoiling
  * add fat sat as default
  * Interleaved partition ordering, with last two even shots swapped
  * Remove arg.spoilersOn option (always on)
